# Roadless scoring: heading-aware conduction on the space a network frees (living note)

Branch `research/roadless`, code in `research/roadless/`. Started 2026-09-29.
pyamg lives OUTSIDE the project env: `~/.cache/reblock-research/pydeps` (pip --target), imported by
`lifted.py`. Run scripts from the repo root with `PYTHONPATH=.`.

## The idea (owner, 2026-09-29)

Forget roads. A network matters only through the buildings its corridor destroys; score how well
people can move through the resulting open space along fairly straight / smooth paths, with no
road/walk distinction. Use it (1) to score any method, (2) to generate clearing methods.

Why it is worth doing, from the record:
- The road/walk conductance ratio DECIDES the ranking and has no physical support
  (notes 2026-08-06, 2026-08-08). Roadless has no such ratio.
- resistance_lp's 6 m mesh threads existing gaps: a road through open ground frees nothing, so
  it should earn nothing here (prediction to test).
- Continuum conduction on the free space was blocked on DISCS (eps reordered methods, 2026-08-05);
  real footprints leave one connected free space (B1, 2026-08-06), and
  `specs/2026-08-06-continuum-on-footprints-design.md` was spec'd on that and never built.

## The model (lifted.py)

State (cell, axis), axes in [0, pi). Along-axis edges join a cell to the next along the axis's
lattice vector (K = 8: king+knight; K = 16 adds (3,1), (3,2)), every crossed cell must be free,
weight m_k / |v|^2; turning edges join adjacent axes in a cell, weight h^2 / (ell^2 dtheta).
Continuum: E(u) = int (d_s u)^2 + ell^-2 (d_theta u)^2. Symmetric, so P = f^T L^-1 f is both the
total expected escape time and the power of the system-optimal LINEAR-congestion routing, and
freeing space can only lower P (Rayleigh). ell = metres travelled per radian of turning.

Demand: each building injects 1 over the free cells within 1 m of it that it is nearest to,
spread over axes by angular share; FIXED at the original footprints (rehoused in place), so only
the operator changes. Ground: cells within 1 m of Block.streets. Homes in pockets sealed at
baseline (no path to ground) are dropped from the demand and counted (`stranded`).

Rules for what a network frees: CARVE (the corridor itself -- what the displacement charge pays
for) and OBLITERATE (every building the corridor touches, whole). Score perm' = 1 - P/P0.

Contention caveat (told to the owner): linear conduction makes co-directional streams contend
(power ~ flow^2), but PERPENDICULAR streams do not (cross term J1.J2 = 0) -- true of today's
permeability too, not new here. The lifted model also weakens oblique (45 deg) interaction.
`lifted.crossing` measures the power share in cells where streams cancel.

## Results so far

**Open channel, angle invariance** (checks.py, angle_h.py; K = 16). Grid offset by
(0.37h, 0.19h) is REQUIRED: with cell centres exactly on axis-aligned channel walls the rasterized
width lost a row and 0/90 deg read 30% worse. After that, P vs angle max/min:

    W 2 m, ell 3:  h 0.5 -> 1.246, h 0.25 -> 1.075
    W 2 m, ell 10: h 0.5 -> 1.380, h 0.25 -> 1.215
    W 4 m, ell 3:  h 0.5 -> 1.074, h 0.25 -> 1.058
    W 4 m, ell 10: h 0.5 -> 1.127, h 0.25 -> 1.107

Discretization, converging in h; worse at large ell (K-limited: off-lattice headings need
turning). K = 8 at ell 10 is bad (1.9). P(W 2)/P(W 4) ~ 2.8, not 2: narrow channels are
penalized beyond width (the injection has to turn into the channel's heading within the width).
Single straight stream crossing diagnostic: power-weighted cancellation 0.11-0.16, share of power
with cancellation > 0.29 at most 1%.

**Cost.** SuperLU: 56-262 s per solve at h 0.5 (fill-in). AMG (pyamg SA + CG, rtol 1e-9): ~10 s
per solve at h 0.5 on 76-316-building blocks.

**h convergence on real blocks (K 16, ell 3) -- NOT converged at h = 1 -> 0.5:**

    18537 (76 bldg):  P0 4837 -> 2250; perm' clearance_looped 0.242 -> 0.318, cycle_native
                      0.708 -> 0.726, resistance_lp 0.675 -> 0.674, greedy_arterial 0.579 -> 0.495
    41132 (138):      P0 2170 -> 1642; 0.218 -> 0.212, 0.261 -> 0.259, 0.394 -> 0.331, 0.269 -> 0.247
    stranded demand 3.6-7.8% and moving with h.

K 8 vs K 16 at ell 3 (h 1 and 0.5): perm' within 0.01 on both blocks -- K 8 is enough at
ell 3. 52727 (316 bldg, K 8): h 1 -> 0.5 perm' clearance_looped 0.441 -> 0.359, cycle_native
0.540 -> 0.491, resistance_lp 0.516 -> 0.455, greedy_arterial 0.558 -> 0.457.

**Crossing streams carry negligible power (gap closed).** Power-weighted share with cancellation
> 0.29 on real blocks, h 0.5: 1.1-1.6% (no roads), 1.0-1.1% (cycle_native at 10%), against up to
1.2% for ONE straight stream in an open channel. Mean cancellation 0.11-0.18 vs 0.11-0.16 for the
single stream. Crossings are where catchments meet; egress flow is overwhelmingly one stream.

**Demand fix (2026-09-29).** First version spread each building's demand over its WHOLE 1 m
ring and dropped the part in sealed nooks, reading 4-8% "stranded". Now demand goes only on ring
cells with a path to the street (per building, renormalized); a building is stranded only if no
ring cell reaches the street. Stranded is then 0-2% at h 1-0.5 and 0.000 at h <= 0.35.

**h convergence, K 8, ell 3, fixed demand** (conv/b*_h*.log). perm' at the Lens A prefix:

h = 1 is unusable. From 0.5 down, values move +-0.03 and not monotonically (P0 on 18537
oscillates), and the top two swap on 41132 and 52727. clearance_looped is last everywhere.
Suspect rasterization flicker of gaps ~h (open/closed by cell-centre placement): testing grid-
offset spread at h 0.5 / 0.35 (conv/off_*.log).

**Grid-offset spread (binary cells) is as big as the h effect** (conv/off_*.log): at h 0.5, four
offsets give e.g. 52727 clearance_looped 0.358-0.403, 41132 cycle_native 0.278-0.316. It is
rasterization FLICKER -- gaps ~h open or close by cell-centre placement. Offset-AVERAGED, the
within-block ranking is identical at h 0.5 and 0.35 on all 3 blocks (18537 cn > rlp > ga > cl;
41132 rlp > cn > ga > cl; 52727 cn > ga > rlp > cl), with a residual level shift ~0.03 on 52727.

**Monotonicity: holds.** 18537 h 1, carve: 48 nested random-order steps, largest relative
increase 0.00e+00.

**Fix for the flicker: sub-cell open fractions** (4 x 4 sub-samples per cell). A cell exists if
any sub-sample is open; an along edge's weight is scaled by the smallest open fraction among the
cells it touches (a gap narrower than a cell conducts in proportion to its width), a turning
edge by its cell's open fraction. Carving/obliterating adds sub-samples, so it stays monotone.
Open channel angle max/min, K 8, ell 3: W 2: h 0.5 1.158, h 0.25 1.073; W 4: 1.059, 1.028
(binary cells K 16: 1.246 / 1.075 / 1.074 / 1.058).

**With sub-cell fractions the score converges** (conv2/, K 8, ell 3; perm' at the Lens A prefix):

Offset spread <= 0.01 on 2 of 3 blocks; 41132 at h 0.5 has one outlier offset (+0.03, the
default one) -- a gap near 0.5 m, presumably. Ranking stable except the 41132 cycle_native /
resistance_lp near-tie (0.005 apart at h 0.25). Stranded 0.000 everywhere. Monotone under both
rules (obliterate: 48 steps, largest relative increase 1.9e-15).

Working resolution: h 0.5, K 8, ell 3, one offset; offset noise to be quantified on a subsample.

## Study: the lineup on the 220 (study.py, rows_h0.5_ell3_K8/)

h 0.5, ell 3, K 8, one grid offset, CARVE unless stated. Same canonical street-first prefixes for
both metrics. (First launch ran 40 workers each with a full BLAS pool: load ~1,240, 6 h for 28
blocks; single-threaded the other 192 took 38 min.) Stranded median 0.000, max 0.068.

    clear         -0.084 [-0.094,-0.073] | -0.081 [-0.096,-0.071]

**Roadless, the four leaders TIE** (arterial, resistance_lp, desire cycle, plain cycle: all
within +-0.004, CIs straddle 0), where the old metric separated them by 0.02-0.03. grid and
clearance_looped close most of their gap. Per-block Kendall tau old vs roadless: median +0.43
(IQR +0.24..+0.62), negative on 11% of blocks. Best-at-Lens-A counts spread out: desire cycle
53, resist_lp 44, arterial 43, cycle 40, grid 32. Frontier (Lens A perm, Lens B displacement)
roadless at P*' 0.25: resist_lp 88, arterial 87, cycle 72, desire cycle 71, grid 41,
clear_loop 18, clear 10 (old: 133, 130, 50, 65, 5, 1, 2).

resistance_lp's mesh does NOT collapse (prediction wrong): at 10% displacement its corridors
widen real alleys; it just loses its old-metric lead. The OLD metric's separation of the leaders
is the road/walk conductance ratio at work: roads are ~200x open ground there.

Obliterate (whole buildings touched) vs carve ranking: tau +0.52; obliterate rewards clipping
many buildings slightly (arterial 0.697). Carve is the rule consistent with the fractional
displacement charge.

Owner 2026-09-29: roadless eval has no road-length axis -- the frontier is permeability vs
displacement only.

## Road-free clearing (clear.py)

Owner's idea: greedy LOO over BUILDINGS, no roads. Exact LOO = one solve per building per step.
TENSION screen: one solve with remaining buildings as eps = 0.01 conductor; first-order gain of
clearing j = sum over its covered edges of (Delta u)^2 x weight gained (dP/dw_e = -(Delta u_e)^2).
Screened greedy: top M by tension, exact solve each, clear the best.

**Tension ranks like exact LOO** (loo_b*.log, h 0.5, single-threaded solves 1.5-1.8 s):

    41132 (138): Spearman(tension, exact gain) +0.930; true best = tension's #1
    18537 (76):  +0.947; tension #1 gets 0.997 of the best gain, top 4 contains it

Top single-building gains on 18537 are 36-39% of P0 each. NOT a sealed-pocket artifact: per-home
escape time max/mean 4.0-5.8 (old metric's no-road tau: 2.4-3.8), top 1% of homes hold 3-8% of
P0 (tail.py). It is a real bottleneck: one building plugging the route many homes take.

**LOO "cancellation" (owner asked).** First order: complete -- P is self-adjoint, so u is its own
adjoint and every conductance derivative (dP/dw_e = -(Delta u_e)^2) comes from ONE solve; that
is the tension. Exact: Woodbury makes P - P_j depend only on u near j and the Green's function
on j's perimeter (~perimeter cells x K, hundreds of solves) -- not cheap. Cheap and CERTIFIED:
a local correction solve in a window around j bounds the gain from above (Dirichlet form: gain_j
<= D_j - r^T L_OO^-1 r, D_j = first-order term) and local flow rerouting bounds it from below
(Thomson); both converge to exact as the window grows. Not built: with 1.7 s solves, M = 4
screening already costs ~5 solves per step. Keep for the large blocks.

**Screened greedy (M 4) vs the lineup** (compare_clear.py; FULL 220: greedy 0.603 vs 0.360-0.368 for
the top four road arms at Lens A, +0.212..+0.218, wins on every block; first read on 139 below):
Lens A roadless perm 0.622 vs 0.37 for the best road arm (+0.216..+0.221 vs the top four, wins
on EVERY block); Lens B P*' 0.25 at D 0.016 vs 0.051 (resist_lp). Frontier: greedy on all 139.

Caveats, measured:
- It is an ORACLE: it optimizes exactly the score it is graded on (cf. the vehicle-access direct
  optimizer). Re-scoring its clearing under other settings (rescore.py: h 0.25, shifted grid,
  ell 1, ell 10) is running.
- It clears SCATTERED, LARGE, often free-standing buildings, not lanes (clear_vs_cycle_native_*.png).
  Displacement counts a building as one home whatever its size, while freed space scales with
  area. At 10% of homes the greedy clears 18.1% of footprint AREA (its buildings average 1.78x
  the block mean) vs 11.4-12.7% for cycle_native / resistance_lp / arterial (area_share.py, 40
  blocks).
- MATCHED ON FOOTPRINT AREA the gap halves but holds (area_match.py, 155 blocks): at 10 / 15 / 20%
  of area cleared the greedy leads the best road arm (cycle_native) by +0.126 / +0.131 / +0.134,
  winning on 95-99% of blocks. And the greedy optimized per home, not per m^2.

**Not a discretization or ell exploit** (rescore.py, 20 random blocks; the greedy's Lens A set
chosen at h 0.5 / ell 3, re-scored; gap = greedy minus the best of resist_lp / cycle / arterial):

    setting   greedy  best road  gap median [min, max]   greedy ahead
    base      0.630   0.437      +0.194 [+0.083, +0.248]  20/20
    h 0.25    0.636   0.445      +0.200 [+0.081, +0.241]  20/20
    shifted   0.633   0.439      +0.191 [+0.064, +0.238]  20/20
    ell 1     0.589   0.395      +0.190 [+0.092, +0.229]  20/20
    ell 10    0.700   0.501      +0.196 [+0.075, +0.277]  20/20

Even a strong straightness preference (ell 10) does not penalize the scattered pattern: the
turning cost prices how paths bend, not whether the open space forms lanes.

Open question for the owner: is a scattered pattern of plazas what the metric SHOULD reward? The
roadless score values open ground near congested homes; nothing in it asks for continuous lanes
beyond the turning cost (ell 3 m is weak).

## Population proportional to footprint area (owner, 2026-09-29)

Owner: buildings contribute (fractional) population proportional to their area. Implemented as a
population Strategy (common.CountPopulation / AreaPopulation, weights normalised to mean 1) that
sets BOTH the escape demand (building j injects w_j) and the displacement (sum_i c_i w_i / sum
w_i; `common.prefix_to` = prefix_to_displacement with weights -- the count version reproduces
the project's prefixes exactly). The greedy ranks by tension per unit population and clears the
best exact gain per unit population displaced. Also robust to Open Buildings merging adjoining
shacks (a merged blob counts by its area). Caveat: large non-residential footprints are
overweighted, and neither count nor area can tell.

Also answered: the score DOES price width (conductance ~ width/length) and straightness (turning
cost) and charges length; what it lacks is a THRESHOLD (a continuous path >= W to the street),
and contention penalizes funnelling, so it widens bottlenecks rather than cutting lanes.

Running: study.py ... area (rows_h0.5_ell3_K8_area/), clear.py ... area
(clear_rows_M4_h0.5_area/).

## Equity: J_p = sum_i w_i u_i^p (owner chose option 2, 2026-09-30)

u_i = building i's CONGESTED escape time: the injection-weighted mean potential of u = L^-1 f over
its ring cells, so sum_i w_i u_i = P and p = 1 is the current score. u_i is half the marginal
total cost of one more person leaving from i (dP/df_i = 2 u_i). Score: 1 - (J_p / J_p0)^(1/p).
- Same family as the screen's closed form (notes 2026-09-19): ring counts are linear in depth, so
  any polynomial weight collapses to n x const x depth_proxy^m; with u roughly quadratic in ring
  depth, J_p at baseline closes to n x const x depth_proxy^(2p) (untested).
- Adjoint: dJ/dw_e = -(du_e)(dlam_e), L lam = p u_i^(p-1) x injection. p = 1 is self-adjoint
  (one solve); p != 1 costs one more solve for ALL buildings. Validated at p 2, area population,
  41132: Spearman(tension, exact LOO gain) +0.936, tension's #1 is the true best.
- NOT monotone in general -- but dead ends are neutral (no steady current into a demand-free
  pocket; that worry was about hitting times). The remaining non-monotonicity is CONGESTION
  SPILLOVER: opening a route for buried homes pushes flow past the homes at its outlet.

Running (2026-09-30 00:47): study.py area rerun with P2_carve and tail columns (u95, umax, umed =
ratio to baseline) into rows_h0.5_ell3_K8_area/ (the p = 1-only area rows are in
rows_h0.5_ell3_K8_area_p1only/, obliterate dropped); clear.py area p 2 into
clear_rows_M4_h0.5_area_p2/; clear.py area p 1 still running (clear_rows_M4_h0.5_area/).

### Area population results (2026-09-30)

Greedy (area, p 1) vs the lineup re-scored with area demand and area displacement
(compare_clear.py 4 0.5 area, all 220): Lens A 0.537 vs 0.327-0.334 for the top road arms,
+0.171..+0.195, wins on every block; Lens B P*' 0.25 at D 0.021 vs 0.068 (cycle / resist_lp /
arterial). Charging by area barely dents the lead: targeting, not the size discount, is most of it.

Tails at Lens A (tails.py area 1): u relative to baseline, median over blocks of the median /
p95 / max home: greedy 0.513 / 0.411 / 0.355; cycle 0.703 / 0.613 / 0.699; resist_lp 0.722 /
0.621 / 0.703; arterial 0.713 / 0.632 / 0.688; grid 0.701 / 0.646 / 0.753. Greedy minus the best
road arm per block: p95 -0.093 [-0.103, -0.086] (better on 96%), max -0.105 [-0.122, -0.087]
(95%). The p = 1 greedy does NOT neglect the buried; it helps them most. Its P2 is 0.569 vs 0.34.

### p 2 vs p 1 greedy (area population, 219 blocks; 5618 still running)

tails.py area 2: greedy p 2 at Lens A: umed 0.531, u95 0.397, umax 0.334, P1 0.543, P2 0.582
(road arms unchanged: u95 0.61-0.65, umax 0.69-0.75). Paired p 2 minus p 1 greedy: median home
+0.018 (p 2 worse on 79%), p95 -0.014 (better on 80%), max -0.011 (76%), P1 -0.004, P2 +0.003.
p 2 does what it says -- trades a little of the median for the tail -- but the effect is small
next to the greedy-vs-roads gap (p95 -0.11, max -0.13 vs the best road arm per block).

## Scaling: batching the greedy (2026-09-30 -- 10-01)

One-at-a-time screened greedy (M4) on ZAF.9.3.1_1_5810 (6,619 buildings, 577k m^2, 14.6M
unknowns, one solve 495 s single-threaded, 11 GB) would be ~800 steps x 5-6 solves: 600-700 h.
Setup fixes: one baseline solve instead of two; building labels by per-footprint bounding-box
rasterization (2 s instead of a whole-grid point query; differs only where footprints overlap).

Pickers (clear.py, a Picker Strategy). Area population, p 2, d_max 0.15, all 220; Lens A
interpolated to exactly D = 0.10 (picker_compare.py; first-step-past-0.10 scored coarse pickers
at ~12%). Medians; diff = paired median vs M4:

Spacing = how alike two candidates' effects are. Impact: correlation of their impact fields
L^-1 dL_i u (energy inner product; the exact second-order cross term for p 1). Sketch: the same
from k random edge-load probes. Catchment: overlap of the homes whose downhill flow passes
through each (no solves). Batch built under a normalised quadratic model, worth_i = g_i -
sum_{j in batch} rho_ij sqrt(g_i g_j) (duplicates worth 0, complements gain). Measured on 41132:
touching pairs ranged rho +0.70 (redundant) .. +0.11 (independent) .. -0.21 (complementary), so
distance is a poor proxy; sketch(400) matched impact (corr 0.95), catchment only weakly (0.35).
- At 1% steps spacing barely matters (every rule ties; +0.0005 over none): the loss vs M4 is
  from not re-ranking after every clearing, not from interference.
- At 3% it matters: catchment recovers ~1/3 of no-spacing's loss at the same cost; impact a
  little more (+0.0025 over catchment) at 3x.
- Impact, sketch and the null were deleted (frontier rule). Kept: M4, B0.01g3 (simplest),
  S0.01cat, S0.03cat.

**5810 done** with B0.01g3: 15 rounds, 7.3 h single-threaded on a loaded machine (vs ~650 h).
Lens A: 618 of 6,619 cleared, roadless perm (p 1) 0.330 vs cycle_native 0.183
(clear_vs_cycle_native_ZAF.9.3.1_1_5810_B0.01g3_area_p2.png). Early rounds breach the dense
fabric along the street edges (all flow converges there: tension = current^2 x conductance gained
peaks at the outlets); later rounds work inward; also clears the large institutional buildings by
the southern field; leaves the sparse west half and the north-east strip nearly untouched.

## Road-favouring conductances (owner, 2026-10-01)

Why the greedy nibbles: in a linear conduction model a channel's conductance grows only as its
width -- a 3 m lane conducts like three 1 m strips -- so nothing rewards space being continuous,
wide or straight. Three candidate fixes, mapped on 5810 before any clearing
(conductance_map.py; owner: "pretty impressed by all three"):
- width: local clear width (2 x distance to buildings; the street side of the edge counts open).
- sightline: longest straight run >= 1.5 m wide over 8 headings.
- vehicle layer: width >= 4.5 m, connected to a street. On 5810 it reaches most of the block,
  so a 4.5 m threshold barely separates lane from gap there.

Segment measure (owner's lift idea): the number of straight segments of length l a W-wide
corridor holds, over positions and headings, is ~ W^2 / l -- so rewarding the FAMILY of segments
gives width^2 without assuming it. Implemented as a per-heading multiplier on the along edges
(lifted.AlongConductance Strategy in Params): layer k's factor = 1 + beta x the angle-weighted
(triangle, one axis gap) mean over 48 fine lattice directions of the run through the cell.
sightline_*.png maps the runs' mean (a connected path network) and dominant orientation (long
coherent alleys). Checks (sightline_checks.py): channel resistance ratio to the original model at
beta 3 falls 0.67 -> 0.46 from W 1 to 8 m (0.82 -> 0.44 at 30 deg); freeing never raises P;
operator build 0.2 s vs 0.1 s.
- Sightline (hard runs, cap 50 m) at beta 3 / 10, greedy S0.01cat on six blocks: SAME scattered
  pattern as the original (alongs_*.png). Road lineup re-scored under it (along_lineup.py, five
  blocks, p 1 at 10%): greedy minus best road +0.110/+0.080/+0.052 (30686, uni/3/10),
  +0.068/+0.023/+0.012 (41148), +0.161/+0.145/+0.147, +0.130/+0.114/+0.121, but +0.170/+0.194/
  +0.282 on 41132 (wide open space whose runs the greedy boosts). Roads gain more than the
  greedy as beta rises, but do not overtake it -- and the road corridors were designed for other
  objectives, so this does not show lanes cannot win.
- SoftSightline (owner: translucent buildings): a ray's intensity falls as exp(-kappa x closed
  length crossed); R_d = expected free path; saturating R / (R + r0) (r0 20 m) instead of the
  arbitrary 50 m cap. Differentiable: vjp by reverse-mode through the 1-D scans, exact to 1e-9
  vs finite differences. Tension now = local + NONLOCAL gain (clearing lengthens rays through
  the building, boosting edges elsewhere); matches finite differences of P within a few % (the
  residual is the old local term's finite step). Measured: the nonlocal term is < 1% of the gain
  at beta 10, kappa 2, and < 2% at kappa 0.3 -- at these strengths lengthening runs is worth far
  less than opening a hole, so transparency alone will not make corridors form.

Beta sweep (SoftSightline kappa 2, greedy S0.01cat, five blocks; 5618 still running): the
pattern stays SCATTERED at every strength (alongs_*.png, uni / ss10k2 / ss30k2 / ss100k2). Greedy
minus the best road arm at 10% (p 1, under each conductance; along_lineup.py):

    block   uni     ss10k2  ss30k2  ss100k2
    19570  +0.161  +0.152  +0.183  +0.198
    30686  +0.110  +0.088  +0.057  +0.068
    41132  +0.170  +0.294  +0.376  +0.438
    41148  +0.068  +0.065  +0.066  +0.070
    63718  +0.130  +0.099  +0.094  +0.099

Roads never overtake; on 41132 the greedy pulls far ahead. Reading (untested interpretation): the
open space between footprints ALREADY forms a connected network of straight-ish channels (the
conductance maps); a strong straight-run bonus makes that network fast, and the binding
constraint becomes the last few metres from homes to it -- which is what the greedy breaches.
A new lane would duplicate a channel that exists. The model's assumption doing the work: every
gap between footprints is walkable (no walls, fences or private yards).

Was running: beta sweep 10 / 30 / 100 (kappa 2) on the six blocks. Next: completion field
(smoothing along headings in the lifted space -- the owner's "smooth only toward nearby
corridors with similar angles"), and corridor-forming via a transparent SEARCH kappa annealed
toward the scoring kappa, if the sweep shows lanes can pay.

### Length response and its scale (owner, 2026-10-01)

Length was SUBLINEAR: g(R) = R / (R + r0) on R = F + B is concave (a 10 m gap earned 1/3 of the
max at r0 20 m). Owner: integrating along a corridor should give length the same quadratic weight
integration gives width. Made exact: the segments along a heading through a cell are the pairs
(start behind, end ahead), F x B of them, summing to L^2 / 2 along a line -- the natural lift
measure is int F_theta B_theta dtheta. As a conductance it chokes a line's ends (B ~ 0 at the
street), and unbounded growth is unphysical, so the metric uses an S-curve on the whole line,
g = R^n / (R^n + r0^n) (SoftSightline hill n; exact vjp kept); F x B is used for display.

Choosing r0 (owner: max entropy / dynamic range). The max-entropy g is the CDF of the block's
line lengths (histogram equalization); the Hill curve IS a log-logistic CDF, so the fit is closed
form: r0 = median L, n = pi / (sqrt 3 sd log L), L = a cell's best line (max over headings,
soft F + B, before clearing). line_scale.py:

    block   n      maxent r0  n    Otsu    percolation (as defined: not discriminating)
    41132   138    31 m      3.3   21 m     60 m
    41148   234    30 m      3.2   23 m     69 m
    19570   312    19 m      2.7   18 m     74 m
    30686   346    20 m      2.4   27 m    146 m
    63718   372    13 m      2.2   13 m     74 m
    5618    759   123 m      1.9   81 m    404 m
    5810   6619    74 m      1.9  122 m    943 m

n ~ 2-3 everywhere (the S-curve's form is what the data prefer); r0 30 m suits the small blocks
but the big ones want 75-120 m. Otsu explains ~0.6 of the variance (not sharply bimodal).
Percolation of the long-line cells to the street stays ~1 until t reaches the block's longest
lines (edge and field runs connect everything): would need restricting to the interior.

S-curve greedy (n 2, r0 30 m, beta 30 / 100), five small blocks: still scattered; greedy minus
best road +0.142/+0.150 (19570), +0.052/+0.035 (30686), +0.368/+0.516 (41132), +0.059/+0.064
(41148), +0.097/+0.119 (63718).

5618 (S0.01cat; uni / sl10 / ss10k2 / ss30k2): the clearing still targets the frontage of the
two built bands around the central field and the street edges; under ss30k2 the F x B view shows
long lines fanning ACROSS the central field between cleared buildings on its two sides -- the
field is the corridor, and the greedy opens its frontage (opened_ZAF.9.3.1_1_5618_S0.01cat.png).
Running: 5618 at the fitted scale (ss100k2n2r123), 5810 (S0.03cat) uni / ss30k2 / ss100k2 /
ss100k2n2r74.

### Speed (owner: "several hours on a big block is a lot", 2026-10-01)

Per solve on 5618 (single thread): h 0.5 setup 7.8 s, solve 29 s at rtol 1e-9 (37 it), 19 s at
1e-5 (P identical), 13.5 s at 1e-3 (P to 1e-6); h 1: setup 1.6 s, solve 5.8 / 3.4 / 2.4 s, P
+2.5%. Tension at rtol 1e-3 ranks IDENTICALLY to 1e-9 (5618, h 0.5 and 1: Spearman 1.000000,
top-100 overlap 100/100) at half the time; set RTOL_TENSION 1e-3, RTOL_SCORE 1e-5.
Search coarse, score fine (rescore_grid.py, S0.01cat, all 220): searched at h 1, re-scored at
h 0.5 at D = 0.10: Lens A 0.534 vs 0.550 searched at h 0.5, -0.0028 [-0.004, -0.002] (coarse
better on 33%); p 1 -0.0024. Compute 6.4 h vs 21.2 h (5618: 658 s vs 2,544 s). Together ~7.5x
on the tension (5618: 106 s -> 14 s).
Not done: a threaded AMG (pyamgcl does not build here -- needs Boost headers); the GPU is busy
with another user's job. 5810 relaunched at h 1, rtol 1e-3, S0.01cat: uni / ss100k2 /
ss100k2n2r74 (the old h 0.5 S0.03cat runs were stopped).

### Translucent search (owner, 2026-10-01)

Tension ranked under a more translucent SEARCH conductance (kappa_search), scoring unchanged
(ss100k2n2r30; `<along>@<search>`); greedy S0.01cat, GPU, six blocks; transparency.py at D 0.10.
depth = median street-distance percentile of the cleared buildings among all buildings; long =
m^2 of previously open space whose best line grew >= 30 m; perm = the run's score (fixed metric).

    block   kappa_s:  2      0.5    0.2    0.05     (depth / long m^2 / perm)
    19570   48.7/151/.836   47.8/284/.848   48.6/165/.840   47.0/205/.820
    30686   50.0/ 52/.732   48.8/ 94/.759   45.1/180/.765   40.8/180/.758
    41132   49.3/ 56/.861   50.0/ 57/.865   54.3/140/.830   52.9/ 45/.642
    41148   56.2/130/.632   54.7/344/.664   53.0/211/.663   54.7/211/.627
    5618    40.6/2300/.876  40.4/4393/.891  32.4/2955/.877  32.3/2322/.844
    63718   52.6/ 81/.835   58.1/159/.798   52.4/178/.652   48.9/134/.602

- NOT deeper: depth flat or SHALLOWER (5618 41 -> 32 percentile at kappa <= 0.2). Counterfactual
  corridors are anchored at the street, so the buildings opening them sit at the frontage.
- LONGER corridors: kappa_s 0.5 roughly doubles the long-line area on 5 of 6 blocks (5618 2,300
  -> 4,393 m^2); 0.05 falls back (everything looks open; the gradient stops discriminating).
- Kappa_s 0.5 also scores BETTER under the fixed metric on 5 of 6 (5618 0.876 -> 0.891, 30686
  0.732 -> 0.759, 41148 0.632 -> 0.664; 63718 worse, 0.835 -> 0.798): the translucent gradient is
  a better search, not just a different one. 0.05 is worse (41132 0.861 -> 0.642, 63718 -> 0.602).
Six blocks only; the 220-block check is cheap on the GPU.

**220-block check (2026-10-01): kappa_s 0.5 wins.** Metric ss100k2n2r30, S0.01cat, h 0.5, CPU,
paired per block (translucent220.parquet), medians:

    perm (J_2) at D 0.10   kappa_s 2 0.7669   0.5 0.7889   diff +0.0144 [+0.012, +0.017]   better on 85%
    perm1 (P)  at D 0.10             0.7048       0.7281        +0.0211 [+0.019, +0.024]             90%
    perm (J_2) at D 0.15             0.8423       0.8526        +0.0119 [+0.009, +0.014]             86%
    largest quarter (n >= 232)                                  +0.0227 [+0.015, +0.026]             87%
    smallest quarter                                            +0.0121 [+0.007, +0.016]             85%

Same cost (one extra layers evaluation per round). A more translucent gradient is a better search
for the sightline metric, most on the big blocks; ss100k2n2r30@ss100k0.5n2r30 is the preset for
that metric. Untested on 220: kappa_s 0.2 (mixed on the six), and whether the gain carries to
the uniform metric (uni has no kappa to soften; a translucent sightline SEARCH for a uni metric
would be a different question).

### 5810 at full resolution on the GPU (2026-10-01)

S0.01cat, h 0.5, GPU solver: uni 1,839 s (the CPU estimate was ~6 h); ss100k2n2r74 3,332 s with
CPU scans; ss100k2 2,446 s with GPU scans (only 27% faster: on 5810 operator assembly, catchment
and the pyamg aggregation now dominate). perm' at D 0.15: 0.385 / 0.703 / 0.628. Pictures
(alongs_ / opened_ZAF.9.3.1_1_5810_S0.01cat_h0.5.png) match the h 1 runs: under sightline,
coherent diagonal bands and several long straight lines through chains of clearings; under uni,
almost none. Three GPU runs plus 18 workers exhausted the 48 GB card (cupy's pool grew to ~20 GB
per 5810 run before the pool release was added).

### GPU-resident rounds (owner: "move the rest to the GPU", 2026-10-01)

Profile of one 5810 round (h 0.5, ss100k2, S0.01cat, GPU solver + scans; profile_round.py):
148 s = catchment sweep 76 (numba, one core) + operator assembly 24 (12 per System) + scan start
cells 16 (rebuilt every call) + pyamg setup 10 + GPU solves 14 + rest. Setup per block 69 s.
Now one round is **13 s** (11x) and setup ~40 s:
- **Edge pattern once per grid** (lifted.Pattern): every edge among the inside cells, built once;
  a field's operator keeps the edges whose cells are all open and fills in weights, on the
  solver's device (numpy or cupy, the Solver Strategy carries xp / sparse / ndimage). Identical
  matrices to the old assembly (max |diff| 7e-15, the float32 layers).
- **Grounded components by labelling** the free mask (4-connected: a diagonal or knight step
  needs every cell it crosses open, so the operator's cell graph is exactly 4-connectivity);
  identical masks.
- **One coarsening per block** (Coarsening, GpuAMG): pyamg's standard aggregation of the
  operator on every inside cell, restricted to each system's unknowns, Galerkin sums on the GPU.
  pyamg's aggregation at strength theta 0 reads only the sparsity pattern, so for the eps
  (tension) systems this is the hierarchy pyamg would build afresh. System setup 5 s -> 0.2 s.
- **K-cycle** (Notay: each coarse correction two flexible Krylov steps preconditioned by the next
  level) instead of a V-cycle: 5810 eps system to 1e-3 in 63 iterations instead of 181, score
  system to 1e-5 in 98 instead of 272 (2.2x the speed). Measured and dropped: 2-3 Jacobi sweeps
  (no gain), strength theta 0.25 (3-7x slower: knight-axis layers lose every strong link),
  Notay's pairwise aggregation (3-10x slower per solve), smoothed prolongators (cuSPARSE's
  products wanted a 52 GB buffer on 5810, still 14-31 GB in row blocks). Convergence stays linear
  (~0.94 per iteration at tight tolerance on 63718), so rtol 1e-9 takes ~350 iterations: the cap
  is now 2000. A better coarsening for this anisotropic operator (aggregates along each heading's
  chains, then across) is the remaining solver lever.
- **Catchment sweep on the GPU** (Sweep Strategy: CpuSweep numba / GpuSweep): the downhill graph's
  topological waves by Kahn's algorithm (a node is ready once all its lower neighbours are; one
  launch per wave; 5618 is 2,113 waves deep, ~1,100 nodes per wave), then one launch per wave
  for the sweep, a thread per (node, candidate). Same arithmetic per node: 76 s -> ~1 s.
- **Tension on the device**: edges, gains, the nonlocal vjp and the building attribution (one
  sparse buildings x cells matrix) never leave the GPU; only u (for the per-building escape
  times) and the per-building gains come back.
- **Grid construction**: block membership by a scanline fill of the boundary rings, footprints by
  per-footprint bounding-box rasterization (what label_sub already did): identical sub-samples
  on four blocks, 5810 58 s -> 6 s.
Checks: new CPU vs old CPU and new GPU vs old GPU on 41132, 41148, 5618: tension within the
solve tolerance (<= 1e-4 relative), identical candidates and picks, Gram matrices <= 1e-4.

**Impact spacing on the GPU: still dominated.** Block CG (16 right-hand sides) makes it 56x
faster than on the CPU (63718, 30 candidates: 6.9 s vs 387 s), but catchment on the GPU takes
0.1 s there, and on 5810 at 3% Impact's Gram had not finished after 12 min against ~1 s. Its
quality edge (+0.0025 over catchment at 3%, a tie at 1%) cannot pay for that; deleted again.

End to end (5810 and 5618, ss100k2, S0.01cat, GPU): identical picks in 14 of 15 rounds on 5810
(the other within solver tolerance) and 15 of 15 on 5618, same scores to 4 decimals; 5810 2,446 s
-> **195 s** of rounds (+ ~40 s setup), 5618 25 s.

**Current maps** (current_map.py; owner: "show the current through a point, not the
conductance"). Per cell, the sum over headings of |flux| under the run's own conductance, before
and after its 10% clearing (current_ZAF.9.3.1_1_5810_S0.01cat_h0.5.png). Before: a dendritic
drainage network toward the street. The diff is global: a cleared gap lights the whole route it
feeds, out to the street (red), and relieves the routes it replaces (blue); under sightline the
red is line-like, long straight streaks running past the cleared buildings. Not monotone per cell
and should not be: only P (and each home's resistance to the street) must fall; flow reroutes
into the new route as traffic does onto a road. Total current (person-metres) fell 1.33M ->
1.23M (uni), 1.41M -> 1.24M (ss100k2).

### Turning sightline (tried and dropped, 2026-10-01)

Owner's ask: corridors that connect and reinforce, bends still rewarded. Built as SoftSightline
with walkers that keep their heading for turn_m metres on average, then take a fresh one worth
Gbar (a power mean, exponent `sharp`, of the free paths over all headings), settled by
fixed-point passes; vjp exact (central differences 1e-6..1e-9, CPU = GPU to 1e-16). On a T
junction (a 50 m stem meeting a bar):
- uniform fresh heading (sharp 1): turning only SHORTENS (most fresh headings hit a corridor
  wall): stem 48 m straight -> 32 m at turn_m 30 -> 19 m at 10; the junction adds ~0.5-1 m.
- best fresh heading (sharp 8, 32): the reverse heading is a "long" option, so walkers
  ping-pong: the stem ALONE scores 54 m, 110 m at sharp 32.
Fixing it (no U-turns, turn only where it pays, a turn cost, a per-metre discount against loops
round a building) builds a longest-polyline reach with no destination, which is exactly what
needs the loop guards. Owner's point: that is a problem of myopia. The flow solve already rewards
connection globally (a gap that joins a corridor carrying flow to the street has a large
tension), the lifted operator already charges curvature (turning edges), and potential flow
cannot loop (it runs downhill: the catchment sweep's DAG). Dropped; the code is in 4f56c4b.
What would revive it: a measured gap that the flow cannot see, e.g. a block where the greedy
leaves a T unjoined although joining it pays under P.

### One convex program, and SIMP (owner: "a very simple single approach?", 2026-10-01)

relax.py. Clear a fraction x_j of each building; open fractions are affine in x, edge weights are
mins of them (concave), and P(w) = max_u 2 f^T u - sum w (du)^2 is convex non-increasing in w,
so min P(x) s.t. population . x <= D, x in [0, 1] is CONVEX. Frank-Wolfe on it: the gradient is
the tension (-du dlam per edge; a min's gradient shared over the cells attaining it, a valid
subgradient), the linear step is the batch pickers' fractional knapsack, and the gap certifies a
bound. Objective in the eps world (J_eps <= J, so the bound covers real clearings). Gradient vs
central differences 1e-6 (p 1 and 2).

Result, 220 blocks, p 1 (P), D 0.10, against the greedy run on the same objective (S0.01cat,
p 1, clear_rows_S0.01cat_h0.5_area); relax220_p1.parquet; medians:

    convex optimum (fractional)        0.670
    certified bound (no clearing beats) 0.675   greedy is 0.150 below it (quartiles 0.13-0.17)
    convex optimum rounded by x        0.445   -0.052 [-0.059, -0.044] vs greedy, wins on 7%
    SIMP (q 1.5 .. 3), rounded         0.516   +0.004 [+0.002, +0.005] vs greedy, wins on 60%
                                               (largest quarter +0.006)
    greedy (BESO-like batches)         0.517
    time per block: greedy 97 s (CPU), relaxation + SIMP 154 s (FW start + 80 OC steps)

- The convex optimum is GREY: 73% of buildings partly cleared (median). P is convex in the
  conductances, so spreading a little clearing everywhere (every building made porous) beats
  concentrating it (Jensen). Corridors pay only because clearing comes in whole buildings: road
  form comes from the integrality, not from the flow model. Hence the weak rounding and a loose
  bound (0.15 above the greedy: it does not say the greedy is near optimal).
- This is topology optimization of heat conduction (the volume-to-point problem; thermal
  compliance f^T K^-1 f = P, conducting material = clearing; Bejan's constructal trees). Its
  standard method, SIMP (material conductivity x^q, q -> 3, optimality-criteria updates), drives
  x to 0/1 and edges out the greedy on P. The greedy itself is that field's BESO (add whole
  elements by sensitivity, a fixed volume step per iteration).
- On J_2 (Lens A), 220 blocks (relax220_p2.parquet; not convex, so Frank-Wolfe is a local
  method and its gap no bound), paired against the J_2 greedy (S0.01cat p 2):

    convex-start optimum (fractional)  +0.141 vs greedy
    rounded by x                       -0.063 [-0.076, -0.051], wins on 3%
    SIMP rounded                       +0.002 [-0.003, +0.006], wins on 55%: a TIE
    SIMP rounded, largest quarter      +0.006 [+0.003, +0.011], wins on 67%
    time: relaxation + SIMP 377 s median per block, greedy 261 s (older run, other load)

  (5618, where SIMP rounded 0.30-0.34 against the greedy's 0.40 from every start, is an
  outlier.) Frontier: the greedy is cheaper and ties overall; SIMP is better on big blocks
  and on P. SIMP still leaves ~8% of buildings grey; its rounding (by decreasing x) is the
  obvious place it loses value.

**SIMP, cheaper** (relax.py plans `fw<FW its>.q<final q>.i<updates per q>.t<step rtol>`).
Warm-started CG (System.solve x0: the last solve of the previous x; the eps world keeps the same
unknowns), solves to 1e-3 while optimizing (scores stay exact), no Frank-Wolfe start (uniform
x = D). 40 blocks (10 largest + 30 random), J_2, D 0.10, against the 220-run plan
fw40.q3.i20.t1e-05:

    plan                  vs 220 plan   vs greedy                     wins   median time
    fw40.q3.i20.t1e-05    --            +0.009 [+0.001, +0.015]       68%    386 s
    fw0.q3.i20.t0.001     +0.000        +0.010 [+0.003, +0.015]       70%     93 s   <- default
    fw0.q5.i10.t0.001     -0.000        +0.009 [-0.003, +0.017]       60%     96 s
    fw0.q5.i20.t0.001     +0.000        +0.010 [+0.002, +0.015]       68%    189 s

Same answers at a quarter of the time. Continuing to q 5 halves the grey (8% -> 4%) but does not
raise the rounded score. (Times are under 12 parallel workers; nearly every block is over
lifted.SMALL unknowns, so these are AMG solves, not direct ones.)

**SIMP on 5810** (J_2, D 0.10, GPU, uni): greedy (S0.01cat) Lens A 0.3189; SIMP fw0.q3.i20.t0.001
**0.3468 (+0.028)** in 164 s wall including setup (the greedy is ~4 min to D 0.15 at today's
speed); fw0.q5.i20.t0.001 0.3476 in 309 s. The gain grows with block size (220: +0.002 overall,
+0.006 largest quarter, +0.028 on the biggest block of all). simp_vs_greedy_ZAF.9.3.1_1_5810_*.png:
SIMP clears 692 mostly small buildings packed into the dense band along the eastern street edge
and the south-west edge; the greedy 524, including the big institutional buildings by the
southern field, more scattered; 279 in both. Neither forms corridors under uni.
Not dominance: the greedy gives every budget in one run (nested clearings: Lens B, phasing),
SIMP one budget per run; SIMP is untested under the sightline conductances.

**SIMP under the sightline metric** (ss100k2n2r30, J_2, D 0.10, 220; the gradient now includes the
factors' response to opening via their vjp, exact against central differences):
    vs greedy, search = metric        +0.003 [-0.002, +0.008] wins 55%; largest quarter +0.010
                                      [+0.002, +0.018] wins 71%
    vs greedy, translucent search     -0.010 [-0.013, -0.006] wins 26%; largest quarter -0.005
SIMP ties the plain greedy and loses to the translucent-search greedy. Untried: SIMP with the
same trick (its gradient under the kappa 0.5 conductance, the objective under the metric).

**Block sizes.** The 220 are small blocks (median 137 buildings, max 759); the region's 28,768
blocks have median 39, but 82 have >= 1,000 buildings (145k buildings, 7.5% of all), 16 >= 2,000
and 6 >= 4,000 (5810 6,619; then 5,396, 5,023, 4,542, 4,374, 4,365). Every 220 result is a
small-block result; block_sizes.parquet lists them all. Large-block benchmark: the 82 >= 1,000.

### Large blocks (owner: "I only really care about the large blocks", 2026-10-02)

The 82 blocks with >= 1,000 buildings, J_2, uni, Lens A at D 0.10, one GPU process at a time
(large82_simp_vs_greedy.parquet; areas in large82_area.parquet).

**What fits.** Area, not building count, sets the memory: the eps world solves on every inside
cell x 8 headings. The greedy completes every block up to ~1.4 km^2 (59 of 82; 30796, 1.5 km^2,
48M unknowns, peaks at 48.2 GB of the 48 GB card), SIMP up to ~1.5 km^2 (61). The other 21-23
(1.4 -- 52 km^2: peri-urban land, 1,000 -- 4,400 scattered buildings) do not fit at h 0.5; they
need a coarser grid or the grid cropped to the built-up area, both model changes (owner's call).
Two memory fixes on the way: GpuAMG.prepare frees cupy's pool per system (the rewrite had
dropped it), and the catchment sweep's (unknowns x columns) output is sized from free memory
and written column-major (cuSPARSE's csr @ dense copied the row-major one: 2x per chunk).

**SIMP (fw0.q3.i20.t0.001) vs greedy (S0.01cat), 59 blocks:** median +0.005 [+0.002, +0.008],
SIMP wins 66%, but mean -0.031: SIMP collapses on six blocks (22422: greedy 0.814, SIMP 0.014;
30848 0.770 / 0.434; 23597 0.772 / 0.503; 20543 0.556 / 0.234; 38616 0.566 / 0.400; 46841
0.573 / 0.429). Median time 2x the greedy's to D 0.10 (5810 the exception: 142 s vs 1,168 s).

**Why it collapses: stranded pockets behind a gate.** 22422's J_0 is 1.2e8 (pockets of homes
with enormous escape times); the greedy's first round clears one building (cost 0.01) and gets
0.534. SIMP optimizes in the eps world, where closed buildings conduct EPS 0.01 and every grey
building x^q of its cells: there the pocket already drains (eps-world Lens A 0.75 with nothing
cleared), so the gate is worth little. At the uniform start x = 0.10 the gate ranks 391st of
1,977 by -gradient / cost (1st at x = XMIN); SIMP ends with it at 0.001.
  - Frank-Wolfe start (fw5): its rounding finds the gate (22422 0.796, 23597 0.751, 20543
    0.496), but the SIMP that follows lands where the uniform start did (0.014, 0.503, 0.234):
    not the start, the leaky grey intermediate states.
  - Smaller eps (plan suffix .e<eps>): 1e-4 and 1e-3 alike fix 30848 (0.434 -> 0.719) and 46841
    (0.429 -> 0.522), leave the other four, and nudge the controls up (5810 0.3468 -> 0.3479).
  - SIMP polishing the greedy's clearing (x0 = its 0/1 set, q 3, or q 2 .. 3): <= +0.007; it
    stays in the greedy's basin (5810: 0.318, where SIMP from uniform finds 0.348).
So neither contains the other: SIMP's grey continuation finds better spread-out clearings
(5810 +0.03), the greedy's exact rescoring finds gates. Best of both, scored exactly, is the
robust answer for large blocks at the cost of running both.

**eps 1e-4 on all 59** (fw0.q3.i20.t0.001.e0.0001; now the plan to use, quality-first; e 0.01
stays selectable, 15% faster):
    vs greedy                      median +0.007 [+0.005, +0.011]  mean -0.026  SIMP ahead on 73%
    vs SIMP at eps 0.01            median +0.001 [+0.001, +0.002]  mean +0.005  ahead on 90%
    best of greedy and SIMP e1e-4  median +0.007 [+0.005, +0.011]  mean +0.009  never behind
Not monotone: 1558 falls 0.523 -> 0.292 at e1e-4 (greedy 0.596). Still collapsed: 22422, 23597,
20543, 38616. Median time to D 0.10: greedy 29 s, SIMP 61 s (e 0.01) / 70 s (e 1e-4); totals
over the 59: greedy 3,681 s, SIMP e1e-4 6,354 s.

### SIMP speed (owner: "why hours and not minutes?", 2026-10-02)

Where the hours went: one SIMP run is <= 80 OC updates of two solves each (forward, adjoint) on
every inside cell x 8 headings (30796: 48M unknowns, 241M nonzeros); the nested path reruns
the whole continuation at 15 budgets (15x); batches multiply again. The greedy is minutes.
Profile of one update on 30796, 5.1 s: solves 2.5 (18 -- 33 K-cycle CG iterations warm, each
fine SpMV 5.6 ms at ~660 GB/s, near the card's bandwidth), AMG setup 1.15, the CSR sort 0.4,
gradient 0.4, host-side home_u and copies 0.5.
Same-answer engineering (0488d72), 5.1 -> 2.8 s per update, SIMP end to end 1.5 -- 1.8x
(5810 169 -> 101 s; picks identical on 3 of 4 blocks, 3 of 621 differ on the fourth):
  - the eps world has the same sparsity pattern on every update: the CSR structure and each
    level's Galerkin map are cached per pattern (setup 1.15 -> 0.13 s), the power iteration for
    the smoother's rho warm-starts (5 iterations, not 30);
  - the K-cycle in single precision under the double outer CG (solves -28%); its dot products
    must accumulate in double (rho2 = bet - gam^2/rho1 cancels to NaN in single). Costs ~1 GB
    more memory: GpuAMG(single=False) stays for blocks at the card's edge;
  - home_u on the device (the 48M potentials no longer go to the host).
Fewer updates (fw0.q3.i10.t0.001.e0.0001 vs i20, 13 blocks): 3x faster in all with the above;
ordinary blocks move by -0.0004 median (-0.004 .. +0.0004), but the gated blocks flip
chaotically: 30848 0.719 -> 0.436, 20543 0.235 -> 0.538, 46841 0.522 -> 0.556. Whether SIMP
opens a gate is basin luck under the grey leak, which is what projection is meant to fix. i10
is the fast preset, i20 the default until projection is measured.

### Projection and the incumbent (owner: "a more natural, non-Frankenstein approach?", 2026-10-02)

Projection (plan .b<b0>-<bmax>: conductance H_beta(x)^q, budget c . H(x), beta doubling per stage)
stops the grey leak: on 22422 the eps world with nothing cleared drops from perm 0.79 to 0.08,
and the gate ranks 1st-2nd by -gradient / cost at the start (8th without). But SIMP still ends
at 0.012 (13 blocks, i10: b8-32 median vs greedy -0.011, b1-32 -0.049; 1558 rescued 0.29 ->
0.53, controls -0.005 .. -0.024).
**Why: the trace** (22422, b8-32): the gate and its two neighbours are substitutes (any opens
the pocket). Half open together, each looks redundant and OC cuts all three by the move limit;
shut, each looks vital and OC raises them: they flip x 0.3 <-> 0.5 every update. The rounding
of update 3 already scores 0.810, of q 2's first updates 0.815 and 0.819 (greedy 0.814); as
beta and q rise the flip breaks the wrong way and the gate ends at x 0.001.
**Incumbent** (plan .k<every>: round every iterate, score it exactly, return the best; repeated
roundings scored once): SIMP proposes 0/1 clearings, the real objective picks.
    12 blocks (6 gated + 6 controls; 1558 OOM), vs greedy at D 0.10:
    i10 (last iterate)    median -0.004  mean -0.126  worst -0.800  ahead 6/12
    i10.k1                median +0.011  mean +0.004  worst -0.037  ahead 8/12   ~2x i10's time
    i10.b8-32.k1          median +0.007  mean +0.002  worst -0.062  ahead 8/12
22422 0.814 / 0.819, 30848 0.782 / 0.708, 38616 0.528 / 0.573, 23597 0.750 / 0.760. Projection
is no longer needed for the collapses; it wins some gated blocks and loses some controls: kept
selectable, i10.k1 is the default. The exact scoring adds a second structure (real world) to
the solver's caches: 1558 (1.38 km^2) now runs out of memory.
