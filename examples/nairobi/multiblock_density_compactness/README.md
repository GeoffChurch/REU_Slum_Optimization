# Multiblock, screened by `density_compactness`

*Dense and compact from geometry alone — the tightest, most built-up blocks by building count per perimeter², found without ever peeling a single parcel ring.*

**Metric:** `density × compactness = n/P²  —  dense, compact fabric (no peel)` — one metric drives the screen, region growth, and colouring end to end.

## 1. Screen the metro

`density_compactness` flagged **257 of 16,200** blocks. Top-scoring: `KEN.30.9_1_3515` (peel depth 2).

**Location:** [see the grown region on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.24628,36.90350,15z).

## 2. Grow the region

The metric grows a **43-block** region (**3,547 parcels**), mean depth 2.4 rings, mean density 67 bldg/ha.

## 3. The permeability frontier (benefit vs added road)

The frontier is the whole trade-off: **permeability** (benefit — the only benefit axis) on the y-axis against **displacement** (cost — the only cost axis) on the x-axis, one line per method. Pareto-dominance — which method buys more permeability for less displacement — reads straight off it (raw per-method samples are in `frontier_permeability.csv`, this dir):

**Before any road is added**, the same region in both colorings: access-depth (blue = at a street, red = deep interior) vs permeability potential (dark = hard to escape, light = easy):

| access-depth | permeability potential |
|---|---|

## 4. Each method on the ground

**Watch each method reblock** — its full road set added busiest-first, each road preceded by whatever it needs to reach the street, so every frame is a network you could actually build. The deep interior drains as the network reaches in:

| Looped Tree | Loop Network | Grid | Direct Objective (LP) |
|---|---|---|---|

### Matched permeability (primary)

Every method truncated where permeability first reaches the standard target, so this compares **what each spends to get there** — in homes displaced and in metres of road. Pinning the benefit and comparing costs is the sounder direction: both costs appear in their own units, so no exchange rate between homes and metres is needed.

| Method | Road | Displacement | Permeability | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Looped Tree | 1,174 m | 3.2% | 60.2% |  |
| Loop Network | 1,551 m | 2.4% | 60.9% |  |
| Grid | 6,570 m | 6.6% | 61.2% |  |
| Direct Objective (LP) | 2,283 m | 1.6% | 60.1% |  |

### Matched displacement (secondary)

Every method truncated to the same displacement %, so this compares the **permeability each buys for the same home-cost**. This lens budgets homes but **not road length**, and the two are not proportional — a metre through a gap displaces far less than a metre through the dense interior. So read `road_m` beside `permeability`: a method showing a higher number at several times the road length has not been shown to be better, only more expensive. Prefer the matched-permeability lens above, which prices both costs.

| Method | Road | Displacement | Permeability | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Looped Tree | 3,729 m | 10.0% | 80.9% |  |
| Loop Network | 10,095 m | 6.9% | 74.9% | converged below budget |
